# managing_tool
I implemented an “Employees manager tool” App, where using spring boot and MySQL database, its backend was created. The app allows two types of users, regular users, and admins, to register and log in. Each user has different rights to access certain data and features within the app, The application was later deployed on the AWS cloud.
